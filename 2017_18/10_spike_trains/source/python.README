I have included these programs in the spirit of disclosure, not
because they are useful: they aren't. They haven't been designed to
work in a robust way and will do silly things when, for example, a
spike is on the division between two bins. I just wrote them to get
diagrams for my lecture notes. Also, I put the spikes unrealistically
close together and then editted the pgf files to correct that, so they
are still wrong in the programs. YMMV.
